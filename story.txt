Beginning (Connor)

There once was a man named Damon who was an excellent basketball player. Damon was on the Wisconsin Badgers football team and 
had earned the job as the starting quarterback. This was historic for Damon and the Badgers as he was just the first true freshman 
to start for the team in the last 10 years. Damon battled the other quarterbacks on the roster during training camp but had proven 
himself to be the best option for the team come time for the first game. Unfortunately, Damon's chance to start and create history 
would all be at risk due to some unfortunate events.

Middle (Liam)
Damon started out training camp strong with his stellar athleticism and rocket arm. Damon was so gifted that he started getting comparisons to the great Wisconsin 
quarterback Russel Wilson. However, his great showing would all come crashing down as he would be overly influenced by other incentives that college provides. Damon 
began to party often and eventually became an acoholic. He was seen one practice chugging a handle of vodka in between reps. Sadly, Damon was cut from the team.

End (Nicole)
Being cut from the team was a wake up call for Damon. After wallowing in self-pity for a few days, he pulled himself together and called his mom for advice.
Damon's mom told him to get his act together, toss the fake ID he was using to satisfy his cravings for alcohol, and apologize to his team. When he approached
his coach and teammates, many of them felt skeptical about inviting him back. He had lost a lot of people's trust. But he seemed remoreseful, so they took him
back on as a fourth-string quarterback. Over the years, Damon worked hard to prove himself to his team, and by his senior year he showed them that he was
serious about football. He got to start during an Opening Day home game, and the crowd welcomed him back with deafening cheers.
