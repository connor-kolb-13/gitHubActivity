Beginning (Connor)

There once was a man named Damon who was an excellent basketball player. Damon was on the Wisconsin Badgers football team and 
had earned the job as the starting quarterback. This was historic for Damon and the Badgers as he was just the first true freshman 
to start for the team in the last 10 years. Damon battled the other quarterbacks on the roster during training camp but had proven 
himself to be the best option for the team come time for the first game. Unfortunately, Damon's chance to start and create history 
would all be at risk due to some unfortunate events.

Middle (Liam)
Damon started out training camp strong with his stellar athleticism and rocket arm. Damon was so gifted that he started getting comparisons to the great Wisconsin 
quarterback Russel Wilson. However, his great showing would all come crashing down as he would be overly influenced by other incentives that college provides. Damon 
began to party often and eventually became an acoholic. He was seen one practice chugging a handle of vodka in between reps. Sadly, Damon was cut from the team.
